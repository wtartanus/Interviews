You cannot return false to prevent default behavior in React. You must call
preventDefault explicitly.

event is synthetic event. React defines these synthetic events according to the
W3C spec, so you don't need to worry about cross-browser compatibility.

SyntheticEvent - a cross browser wrapper around the browser native event. It has 
the same interface as the browser's native event, except the events work 
identically acros all browsers.

Event Pooling - the synthetic event is pooled. This means that the SyntheticEvent
object will be reused and all properties will be nullified after the event 
callback has been invoked. This is for performance reasons. As such, you 
cannot access the event in an asymchrous way.
