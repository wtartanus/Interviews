Statement
    In a computer language, a group of words, numbers, and operators that performs
    a specific task is a statement.

Expression
    is any reference to a variable or value, or set of variables and values
    combined with operators

Operators 
    are how we perform actions on viarables and values.

Blocks
    in code we often need to group a series of statements together, which we often 
    call a block. In JavaScript, a block is defined by wrapping one or more
    statements inside a curly-brace pair {}

Loops
  while (num > 0) {}
  do {} while (num > 0)
  for (var i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {}

Scope 
    is basically a collection of variables as well as the rules for how those 
    variables are accessed by name. In JavaScript, each function gets its 
    own scope.
