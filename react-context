Context provides a way to share values like these between components without 
having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.

Context is designed to share data that can be considered 'global'
for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user,
theme, or preferred language.

Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible
by many components at different nesting levels. Apply it 
sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult.

If you only want to avoid passing some props throught many levels,
component composition is often simpler solution.
