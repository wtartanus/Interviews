Inheritance
 is the proccess of creating new classes, called derived classes, from base classes where an 'is-a' relationship exists.
 The derived class extends from the base class in order to inherit its properties.

Polymorphism
 is the ability of an object to take on many forms. For example, square, rectangle, circle and triangle classes can have
 the same parent class Shapes, but each class can have its own method named drawShape();

Abstraction
 in OOP refers to showing only the essential features of an object to the user and hiding the other details to reduce
 complexity.

Encapsulation
 in OOP refers to biding the data and the methods to manipulate that data together in a single unit (class).
 This is normally done to hide the state and representation of an object from outside.
